# Indian-International-Trade

1. Currently Only Front End Files have been uploaded.
2. Basic Idea is to provide a platform for uploading blogs related to Indian Trade only after admin verification.
3. Also This platform provides you donated books, books for rent, and books for sale from authorised publisher.
4. If possible we also provide platform for all organisation(school,colleges, or writers/bloggers from article industry) to showcase their project or research projects
5. I have uploaded login-signup model in nodejs and mongodb functioning. All codes of this module resides in Login directory. Also please includes node_modules directory with all modules of node. Can't Upload it due to large number of files.
